Taidacent TTL

NOTES: 
- Out of the box, the readings for the sensor are SUPER high. The sensor needs a few minutes to stabalize in reading.
  I left mine out for about 5 minutes and the readings dropped from high 4s to low 3s/high 2s. I'm sure the voltage
  will drop with more time though. 
- I'm pretty sure that mine works because I stuck the sensor on top of an acetone bottle and the readings spiked up
